## Paper Notes

### Summary
In "What is it like to be a bat?", Thomas Nagel delves into the enigmatic realm of consciousness, pondering the subjective experience of other beings. He argues that understanding consciousness requires more than just objective, third-person observations; it necessitates grasping the unique perspective and qualia of individual minds. Using the example of bats, Nagel explores the limitations of human comprehension when it comes to truly understanding the subjective experience of non-human creatures.

### Key Findings
- Nagel contends that consciousness involves more than just behavioral responses or neural processes; it encompasses the ineffable "what it's like" aspect of experiencing the world from a particular viewpoint.
- He suggests that even if we were to fully comprehend the neurobiological mechanisms of bat cognition, we would still lack insight into their subjective experience of echolocation and flight.
- Nagel challenges the reductionist approach to consciousness, asserting that subjective experience cannot be fully explained by objective, scientific analysis alone.

### Highlights and Takeaways
- Nagel's paper provokes deep philosophical reflection on the nature of consciousness and the limits of human understanding.
- It highlights the importance of incorporating subjective experience into discussions of consciousness and cognition.
- The concept of "what it's like" to be another organism raises profound questions about empathy, interspecies communication, and the boundaries of knowledge.

### Other Notes/Additional Thoughts
The discussion during our paper group centered on the challenging nature of subjective experience and its implications for our understanding of consciousness. We pondered the idea that certain truths may exist beyond the grasp of human language and cognition, leading to a realm of unknowable knowledge.

We also debated Nagel's definition of consciousness and its adequacy for capturing the full spectrum of subjective experience. While we agreed that it provides a useful framework for this conversation, we think it is not a sufficient definition for consciousness at large.

Additionally, we explored the thought experiment of "Mary's room," contemplating whether full knowledge of physical facts about color would equate to experiential knowledge. We pretty much agreed that Mary would still gain something new upon experiencing color firsthand, suggesting that understanding "experience" itself seems crucial and beyond 'physical facts'.

Finally, we discussed the parallels between Nagel's arguments and the challenges of interpretability in AI systems. While we lacked expertise in either field, we speculated on the potential implications of a physicalist worldview for understanding the inner workings of artificial intelligence and that it may be a kind of bridge to a response to Nagel if/when achieved.
