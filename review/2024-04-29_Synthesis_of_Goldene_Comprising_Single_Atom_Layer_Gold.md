## Paper Notes

### Summary

The paper outlines the innovative synthesis of 'goldene,' a monolayer gold 
material derived from a nanolaminated Ti3AuC2 MAX phase. Through a scalable and 
hydrofluoric acid-free wet-chemical etching process, goldene is produced with 
distinct and potentially beneficial properties for applications in electronics, 
catalysis, and biomedicine.

- MAX phases are a family of carbides and nitrides that possess a layered 
  structure which are unique for their metallic and ceramic properties

While single-atom-thick materials are not _new_, metals have been historically
difficult to work with. This paper represents a breakthrough in that regard, and
the techniques employed here might be relevant to other metals. This team, for
example, is going to pursue Silver next.

### Key Findings

- Successful synthesis of monolayer gold (goldene) using an acid-free chemical 
  etching process.
- Observation of 9% lattice contraction in goldene compared to bulk gold.
- Increased Au 4f binding energy in goldene, suggesting altered electronic 
  properties conducive to various applications.

### Highlights and Takeaways

- Goldene demonstrates intrinsic stability and unique electronic properties, 
  confirmed through AIMD simulations and XPS measurements.
  - AIMD - Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics simulations are a powerful computational 
    technique used to study the behavior of materials at the atomic level using 
    quantum mechanics and simulating atomic movements.
  - XPS - X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy is a surface-sensitive quantitative 
    spectroscopic technique that measures elemental composition, chemical state, 
    and other properties of materials.
- The method avoids the use of hazardous hydrofluoric acid, using Murakamiâ€™s 
  reagent instead, providing a safer and easier to store option.
- Potential applications include enhancing catalytic activity due to its high 
  surface-area-to-volume ratio and its use in electronic and photonic devices.

### Other Notes/Additional Thoughts 

This was a relatively straightforward paper about the creation of a new 2 
dimensional material which seems likely to have unique properties.
